 So this is built using webRTC protocol which is under UDP , so lets understand the underlying things how the webRTC works under the hood before that you need to know the basis of networking which is why do we use UDP 
 instead of HTTP protocol for videcalling as HTTP protocol is a reliable protocol where we expect a lot of things to happen and it works under many restrictions and hence takes a lot of time to process during a request 
 but in case of UDP its blazingly fast as we dont expect anything we just want to see each other if some packets get lost it doesnt matter right ?  so webRTC comes into the picture built under UDP its super fast for P2P 
 and data transfer
